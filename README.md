# GraphRag
This is my final Year Project Graphy v1 is an innovative project that enhances large language models through graph-based knowledge retrieval by integrating LangChain, Neo4j, and OpenAI's GPT models. The system allows users to query graph databases using natural language, extract insights from documents, and visualize concept relationships effectively.
The workflow begins with document upload and preprocessing, which includes text extraction and potential translation to English. The system then chunks the text to identify entities and relationships using natural language processing techniques. These elements are stored in a Neo4j graph database, where nodes represent entities and edges represent their relationships. Users can interact with the knowledge graph by asking questions in natural language, which are interpreted and converted into Cypher queries to retrieve information, presenting results as text responses or visual graph representations.
The project addresses challenges in querying large datasets and visualizing complex relationships dynamically. Its applications span multiple domains including research, business intelligence, education, healthcare, and enterprise data analysis. By transforming unstructured text into structured, queryable knowledge graphs, Graphy v1 serves as a powerful tool for information-rich environments across industries.
